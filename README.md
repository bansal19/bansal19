# Hey, Welcome to my Github Profile!

I work on [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/). 

Notable highlights:
- I started at AWS in July 2021. Most of my time there has been spent on scaling the Data Plane of Cloud Map, where we serve [DiscoverInstances requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DiscoverInstances.html).
- I like thinking about how machine learning can have a meaningful impact to solve real world problems. I led, alongside [Elias Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-williams/), a team of 20 people to host a 3 month long machine learning competition focussed on Climate Change. Check out [ProjectX 2020](https://www.projectx2020.com/)
- I did a research project under [Ala Shaabana](https://github.com/shibshib) called [Bittensor](https://opentensor.github.io/). While I'm not able to spend much time on it now, what they're doing is really cool. --> Decentralising machine learning training. 
- I'm fond of reading, but I often don't do it enough. I'm trying to re-read Cal Newport's Deep Work and Digital Minimalism to try and live with more intent.
