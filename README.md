# Hey, Welcome to my Github Profile!

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student graduating in June 2021 from the University of Toronto.

Check out some of my interests
- I like thinking about how machine learning can have a meaningful impact to solve real world problems. I led, alongside [Elias Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-williams/), a team of 20 people to host a 3 month long machine learning competition focussed on Climate Change. Check out , check out [ProjectX 2020](https://www.projectx2020.com/)
- I'm currently doing a research project under [Ala Shaabana](https://github.com/shibshib). It's called [Bittensor](https://opentensor.github.io/) and we're trying to decentralise machine learning training. 
- I'm fond of reading, but I often don't do it enough. I'm trying to re-read Cal Newport's Deep Work and Digital Minimalism to try and live with more intent.
