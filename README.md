# Hey, Welcome to my Github Profile!

I work on [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/). 

Notable highlights:
- I started at AWS in July 2021. Most of my time there has been spent on scaling the Data Plane of Cloud Map, where we serve [DiscoverInstances requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DiscoverInstances.html).
- I like thinking about how machine learning can have a meaningful impact to solve real world problems. I led, alongside [Elias Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-williams/), a team of 20 people to host a 3 month long machine learning competition focussed on Climate Change. Check out [ProjectX 2020](https://www.projectx2020.com/)
- I worked on a research project ([Bittensor](https://opentensor.github.io/)) under [Ala Shaabana](https://github.com/shibshib). I developed early benchmarking for performance of neural networks against other open source widely used LLMs. While I'm not able to spend much time on it now, what they're doing is really cool. --> Decentralising machine learning training. 
- I'm fond of reading, but I often don't do it enough. If you want to talk to me about some reading, pick my brain about thoughts I have on Cal Newport, Michael Singer, Malcolm Gladwell, Ernest Cline or Andy Weir.
