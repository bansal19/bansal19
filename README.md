I'm currently building something new in the climate space.

Notable highlights:
- I worked on [AWS Cloud Map](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/) and left in late 2023. Most of my time there was spent on scaling the Data Plane of Cloud Map, where we serve [DiscoverInstances requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/api/API_DiscoverInstances.html).
- I like thinking about how machine learning can have a meaningful impact to solve real world problems. I led, alongside [Elias Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elias-williams/), a team of 20 people to host a 3 month long machine learning competition focussed on Climate Change. Check out [ProjectX 2020](https://www.projectx2020.com/)
- I worked on a research project ([Bittensor](https://opentensor.github.io/)) under [Ala Shaabana](https://github.com/shibshib). I developed early benchmarking for performance of neural networks trained decentralized against other open source widely used LLMs.
- I'm fond of reading. Reach out about my [recent reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158036743-shardul-bansal).
